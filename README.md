# Google NL API Testing
This aim of this is to create a series of scripts that will be able to parse a local PDF file to get the contents in text form. With this text then send to the [Google Natural Language API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/) for analysis.

These scrips will be built in a simple Express.js appllication to act as our API to interact with.

## Run Project
``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve at localhost:3000
$ npm run live
```

###### *Note you will need to have your computer setup with the Google Cloud Platform for this to funcion correctly.

## Tools:
* [Google Natural Language API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/)
* [PDF Parse Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-parse)
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
