        "title":"Can you build a gaming PC at Best Buy on Black Friday?",
        "text":"When I was growing up, Best Buy was pretty much never really a place you could go to build a new PC. Sure, you could capitalize on some Best Buy Black Friday deals to pick up a new hard drive if you were running out of storage, but you could never use it as a one stop shop, like you could in a place like Micro Center. However, Best Buy is slowly becoming a better, well-stocked place to pick up all things PC. Now, obviously, you won't find the same degree of variety as you will in a more specialist retailer or online at Newegg, but if you're living in the suburbs and a big box store is all you have available to you, its still possible to get most of your computer shopping in one spot. Best Buy PC Components Not the best selection but still everything you need. Because I have these memories of Best Buy being a PC component desert, I've been increasingly surprised when seeing some pretty decent deals come out of its online store, especially during seasonal shopping events like Black Friday. The way I always looked at that was that the online store just had more variety because it had a whole warehouse to ship things out of. So, naturally I went to my local Best Buy to awkwardly wander through the computing section. And, frankly, I was surprised at just how many computing components Best Buy had on offer. The first thing I saw when I meandered over to the computing components aisle – there was just one – was an entire row of PC power supplies. Nothing super high-end like a 1200W unit, but plenty of 850W 80+ Gold PSUs that should be more than good enough for most people. That's good - everyone should have access to power supply that won't set their house on fire. Of course, there were also plenty of Motherboards, SSD and RAM kits available, and the prices were mostly reasonable. One notable thing we noticed was a 32GB kit of Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro at 3,200 MHz for $176, which is about the same price as you'll find on Amazon or Newegg. This was a common theme among the PC components we found at Best Buy: maybe $5 more expensive at most, and sometimes even cheaper than the manufacturer's website. So, basically, you won't have to pay an obscene price to conveniently buy your PC components at your local Best Buy. The only thing I couldn't seem to find at Best Buy was a PC Case. I found plenty of cheap pre-built Desktop PCs that you could gut and customize with more high-end components, but no empty chassis to build in. However, if all you have to buy online is a PC case, that doesn't seem too bad, especially if you already have a PC case you're willing to keep. Of course, you can always buy a PC case online and pick it up at your local Best Buy. Best Buy PC components You could basically make this from parts you'll find at your local Best Buy. Now that you can actually find a majority of the PC components you'll need to build a new PC at Best Buy, it's not hard to recommend. I even found plenty of all-in-one liquid CPU coolers and thermal paste. Best Buy isn't on the same level of a computing-centric retailer like Micro Center, and if you live in an area with access to a Micro Center, that's still the retailer we'd recommend. Even Micro Center's online store is better suited to PC enthusiasts than other web stores. However, if your choices are shopping online and heading over to Best Buy, it's not an awful idea to head to the blue-themed retailer. Not only will you get that instant gratification of opening your new PC components minutes after buying them, but if you get a lemon (it happens to all of us), its really easy to return without having to deal with return labels and shipping containers. I'm pretty sure that we're going to see some amazing Black Friday component deals this year, especially on AMD processors and graphics cards now that Navi and Ryzen 3rd Generation have arrived. So, if you have a PC build dream list that you've been saving for the right moment, you might want to head over to Best Buy. And if you can't wait until Black Friday, don't worry. I went ahead and found some juicy PC component deals for you."

        "text":"Major software updates often come with one or two bugs attached, and that seems to be the case with macOS Catalina – some users are reporting that email messages are going missing in Apple Mail. As AppleInsider reports, the problems lie in moving messages around, and in syncing them with other devices. In certain cases the emails can apparently disappear completely. Further problems can occur when backing up emails, with Mail not always downloading all of the message information that it needs to. Difficulties can also occur when restoring data from an email archive. Our verdict on the iPhone 11 The Pixel 4 leaks just keep coming Everything to know about Apple Arcade Michael Tsai, who develops the EagleFiler and SpamSieve plug-ins for Apple Mail on macOS, has outlined some of the issues that have cropped up in a blog post – he advises holding off on a Catalina upgrade, if you rely on Apple Mail, until these bugs have been fixed. A bug's life What's not clear is just how many people are being affected by the bugs outlined by Tsai: based on forum posts, it seems that the number of users who've actually lost email is relatively small. Beta versions of the software have been out for four months. It's also worth noting that Tsai says the bugs could be something to do with the servers Apple is running, or the Mac more generally, rather than Apple Mail specifically. Expect more details to emerge as time goes on. Apple itself hasn't commented on the problem officially, but may well take steps to address the reported problems in the next macOS Catalina update. The new desktop operating system upgrade adds a few extra features to Apple Mail, including the ability to mute email threads that are getting too busy, and to block messages from specific senders."

        "text":"Medical research is hindered by the growing costs of cloud computing. During a recent discussion about bio sequencing, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg questioned why cloud computing costs have become so expensive. He specifically called out Amazon's cloud computing service, AWS and suggested it might be a good idea to call up Jeff Bezos to discuss the issue further. Back in 2015, Zuckerberg and his wife Pricilla Chan founded the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) and the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub with the aim of using technology to advance research into health, social and scientific issues. During a live chat on Facebook, which was moderated by Zuckerberg, the research center's co-presidents Dr. Joseph DeRisi and Dr. Stephen Quake made the point that scientific progress is often impeded by the high costs of cloud computing services. Apple is spending millions each month on AWS Enterprises look to optimize cloud spend as costs grow AWS now makes up more than half of Amazon's revenues Zuckerberg explained that the Biohub's high AWS bill is often discussed in its meetings, saying: In our bio board meetings, one of the things we talk about is the cost of the compute, and our AWS bill, for example, is one of the specific points. Let's call up Jeff and talk about this. It's interesting, the bottleneck for progress, in medical research at this point, a lot of the cost for it, is on compute and the data side and not strictly on the wet labs or how long it takes to turn around experiments. Medical research. The Biohub receives billions of dollars in funding from Facebook but LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman is also a big contributor. Other organizations and research labs around the world aren't so lucky when it comes to investment though and Dr. Quake explained that the high costs of cloud computing services are often a barrier that many are unable to overcome, saying: This is no more apparent than in the developing world or low-income resource settings. The cost of the sequencing and the lab work has gotten to the point where you can do this almost anywhere in the world. It's gotten that cheap. The compute to be able to analyse that data is unfortunately not available to the vast majority of the people that do that. It's very often the case that you'll go to one of these low-income resource settings, they'll have a sequencer but its collecting dust because they can't compute. Even if they can access the cloud, they can't afford it. Governments may need to eventually convince cloud providers to lower their costs if live-saving advancements in medicine and research are to continue.

        "text":"iPhone maker spends $30m a month on Amazon's cloud services. As Apple looks to expand its services business to make up for lost iPhone sales, new information has revealed that the company is spending more than $30m a month on Amazon's cloud service AWS. The company's cloud expenditure shows just how determined it is to deliver online services such as iCloud quickly and reliably even if it has to depend on a rival to do so. Apple customers use more than one billion of its devices each month which has led its computing and storage requirements to grow immensely. The company is planning to build out its own infrastructure to handle this influx in user data and in January 2018, it announced plans to spend $10bn on data centers in the US within five years. AWS now makes up more than half of Amazon's revenues. Apple shipments fall by a fifth in China. Formula 1 gets even smarter with AWS. While Apple depends on smaller third-party cloud providers to deliver its services it also relies on big cloud providers such as AWS and Google while Microsoft has provided cloud tools to the company in the past. The company has revealed in the past that it uses AWS for iCloud storage but it did not disclose whether any other Apple services use AWS or other third-party clouds. Rising AWS costs. At the end of March of this year, Apple's spending was on track to average over $30m per month in the first quarter. According to those familiar with the matter, this will be more than 10 percent higher than during the same period a year ago. If Apple continues to use AWS at those levels for the rest of the year, its annual spending on Amazon's cloud services would exceed $360m. The company's cloud expenditures will likely continue for the foreseeable future as it recently signed an agreement that includes a commitment to spend at least $1.5bn on AWS over the course of five years. Apple is not the only company to make a long term agreement with Amazon for its cloud services as Lyft, Pinterest and Snap have all committed to paying AWS $300m, 750m and $1.1bn respectively for its services over the next few years.

        "text":"Latest Gartner figures show sales are on the up once again as Windows 10 refresh cycle helps boost numbers. PC sales have risen again in the latest surprising report concerning the once-struggling market. According to the latest figures from Gartner, sales saw a 1.1 percent growth during the third quarter of 2019 as the demand for newer devices running the latest version of Windows 10 helped drive sales across the world. Overall, Gartner saw global shipments total 68.1 million units in Q3 2019, up from 67.3 million in the previous period, despite worries that the market was set to slip into decline following a number of high-profile incidents. The best student laptops in 2019 - Dell XPS 13 review Intel fights back against AMD with a price cut for popular Core i5-9400F budget CPU. Windows 10 push Lenovo maintained its place as the world's top PC manufacturer, shipping 16.8 million units during the quarter, a 5.8 percent growth based on the same period in 2018. HP remained in second place, shipping 15.2 million units (a 4.6 percent increase), with Dell in third (11.3 million units), and Apple and Acer rounding out the top five. Apple's market share was the only one in the top five to decline over the time period, falling 3.7 percent to leave the company with 7.5 percent of global share. Microsoft was ranked seventh in the worldwide market, with Chromebooks not included in Gartner's figures. The Windows 10 refresh cycle continued to be the primary driver for growth across all regions, although the magnitude of the impact varied according to local market conditions and the stage of the refresh cycle, said Mikako Kitagawa, senior principal research analyst at Gartner. Neither the Intel CPU shortage nor the U.S.-China trade war had a significant impact on PC shipments in the third quarter of 2019. The Intel CPU shortage has continued to ease, and U.S. tariffs on China-built mobile PCs had a minimal impact on PC shipments as the date for the potential increase in tariffs was pushed out to December 2019, said Ms. Kitagawa.

Yesterday's 47-5 win over Samoa was enough to earn Joe Schmidt's side a place in the last eight, but their loss to the hosts in round two cost them an extra day's preparation and sets them up for the toughest quarter-final they have ever faced against the reigning world champions who are going for three in a row.

The win ensured Japan finished top of Pool A and will face Pool B runners-up South Africa in Tokyo next Sunday, with Ireland facing Pool B winners New Zealand at the same ground on Saturday (11.15am Irish time, live on RTÉ television and radio). Gregor Townsend's Scots needed an eight-point triumph to book a quarter-final slot and it looked promising when Finn Russell put them ahead early. But the Brave Blossoms hit back with a series of ceaseless attacks as they repeatedly crashed through the Dark Blues to secure top spot in Pool A and a rematch with their 2015 victims South Africa. Kenki Fukuoka grabbed a double either side of halftime as the tournament hosts were roared on by a sea of red and white jersey-wearing fans with a frenetic attacking game and ferocious defence. Star winger Kotaro Matsushima scored his fifth of the tournament but it was prop Keita Inagaki who finished off a stunning move that will be hard to beat for try of the competition. Scotland refused to go down without a fight and battled back from 28-7 down with half an hour left but second-half scores from forwards WP Nel and Zander Fagerson were not enough to prevent the Scots suffering their second pool exit in three tournaments."

        "title":"Coleman accepts Ireland's fate knowing they need a win",
        "text":"Seamus Coleman had already accepted the Republic of Ireland would have to beat either Switzerland or Denmark to qualify for the Euro 2020 finals before it became a mathematical certainty. Ireland's 0-0 draw in Georgia on Saturday evening and the Danes' 1-0 victory over the Swiss in Copenhagen left the two sides level at the top of Group D, with Switzerland four points behind but having played a game fewer. But as they set off from Tbilisi ahead of Tuesday's trip to Geneva, skipper Coleman was in bullish mood with a win either over the Swiss or against Denmark in Dublin next month enough to guarantee automatic qualification. He said: I do think we're capable of a big result, I've always said that. Over the last few years, we've proven that bar that bad year last year, we are capable of big results. We have to go for it anyway Tuesday night. We won't be sitting back - the game might dictate that you might sit back, but we'll be going there looking for the win. That is exactly the approach Mick McCarthy's men insisted they were adopting before the game at the Boris Paichadze Arena, but they found themselves on the back foot for long periods as Georgia dominated possession without creating clear-cut chances. Ireland might have won it through a first-half John Egan header which came back off the post, and from two later chances for 19-year-old substitute Aaron Connolly, who lit up the game's dying moments on his senior debut. However, Coleman was pragmatic when asked if two points had slipped from their grasp. He said: Ah look, we wanted to win the game, but then you come back in and you realise you got a point, you got a clean sheet and we're capable of a big result. Ideally, we would have liked three points, but it wasn't to be. Tuesday night's game looks even bigger as a result of what happened in Tbilisi, where Denmark were also held to a 0-0 draw last month, although Coleman is not convinced. He said: Well, it does and it doesn't. You go into the game wanting to win and that won't change because of tonight's result. We always want to win the game - playing for draws and stuff like that is dangerous anyway, so we always go out and try to win a game and Tuesday night will be no different. Look, we're going to play a top team, but I believe in the lads and if we can be a little bit more composed, we can get a result. If there was an element of disappointment on the final whistle in Georgia, there was also a frisson of excitement at Connolly's impressive cameo. Coleman said: He stretched them, he looked confident, he had a couple of chances - not clear-cut chances by any means, but he's dangerous. He's a good lad, he's got that quiet confidence as well. Without putting too much pressure on him, we're delighted to have him and hopefully he can have a big future for us."

        "text":"Ireland are flying a specialist lawyer into Japan in a bid to keep Bundee Aki's World Cup alive. Connacht centre Aki was sent off for a high tackle on UJ Seuteni in Ireland's 47-5 win over Samoa on Saturday, that booked Joe Schmidt's men a World Cup quarter-final. Ireland expect Aki to face a disciplinary hearing in the next 36 hours, where the 29-year-old could be hit with a suspension that could end his World Cup. But the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) has confirmed that William Fry partner Derek Hegarty is en route to Japan, to act for the union in any eventual hearing. Defence coach Andy Farrell said Ireland are still awaiting referee Nic Berry's official match report, but admitted his personal sympathy for any player who is sent off. I feel sorry for everyone who gets a red card, said Farrell. I don't know anyone in world rugby who wants to do anything like that on a pitch. I'll keep my powder dry until after the process; we haven't had the referee's report yet, so we'll wait until after that. We believe there will be a hearing in the next 36 hours, so we'll see how that goes. Reaction stuff is very tough to judge, you can slow everything down and everyone has a comment. I'd like to think there's a bit of feel in and around the whole situation. Ireland boss Schmidt said Aki was devastated to have been sent off against his fatherland Samoa in Saturday's seven-try win in Fukuoka. Samoa head coach Steve Jackson immediately pledged to make any possible representation to World Rugby, in the hope Aki would not receive any further punishment than his red card. Previous red cards have been met with three-match suspensions at this World Cup however, and Aki might suffer the same fate - which would rule him out of any further action at the tournament. Former Terenure scrum-half Hegarty heads up the sports division at Dublin firm William Fry, who advised the IRFU on its bid to host World Cup 2023. Schmidt said he would be pretty disappointed if Aki's red card turned into a suspension for him to miss the remainder of the World Cup. While assistant coach Farrell remained fairly tight-lipped on views on Aki, the former dual-code rugby international admitted Ireland were delighted to have reached the World Cup's knockout phase. It's all about moving onto the next round, which we're pretty pleased with, to get a chance to go for a quarter-final, said Farrell. We're pretty pleased with how we dealt with and managed the game against Samoa. It was tricky enough conditions. I don't think watching on TV at home you'd have been able to tell, but it was very blustery out there and I thought we managed the conditions pretty well. We played a good bit of territory in the first-half and got a good bit of reward of that. It was tough playing against the wind in the second-half, but then we managed to stay in the Samoa 22 for a good while. So overall we're very pleased to be sat here with a win."

        "text":"Wales secured a World Cup quarter-final clash against France next Sunday - but they ended their Pool D campaign with an unconvincing 35-13 victory over Uruguay. The Six Nations champions fielded only three of their probable last-eight starting XV - wing Josh Adams, centre Hadleigh Parkes and flanker Justin Tipuric. But that could not excuse an often laboured, error-strewn display in Kumamoto as Uruguay - shock conquerors of Fiji last month - gave Wales a real battle. Wales led by only a point at half-time following prop Nicky Smith's try that full-back Leigh Halfpenny converted. Adams then claimed his fifth touchdown of the tournament, with Halfpenny again adding the extras, but Uruguay stayed in touch through two Felipe Berchesi penalties. Unbeaten Wales finished top of their group with a best pool-phase performance since the 1987 World Cup, yet their latest success will not live long in the memory. Wales got the job done. A 65th-minute penalty try took them further ahead, and although Berchesi converted hooker German Kessler's touchdown, Wales added further scores in the final seven minutes from Tomos Williams and Gareth Davies, both converted by Halfpenny. Tipuric captained a much-changed Wales team, with head coach Warren Gatland making 13 switches from the side that beat Fiji four days ago. It meant first starts of the tournament for players like wing Hallam Amos, hooker Ryan Elias and lock Adam Beard as Wales looked to keep their winning World Cup run going. A minute's silence was observed before the anthems as a show of solidarity with everyone affected by Typhoon Hagibis.  When the game started, Wales showed plenty of attacking intent, with Tipuric and wing Adams prominent. Flanker Aaron Shingler almost went over in the corner for a try, but Uruguay were struggling to cope with mounting pressure, and Smith claimed a 17th-minute touchdown that Halfpenny converted. Wales did not have it all their own way as Uruguay combined some strong defence with attacking ambition, and fly-half Berchesi opened their account by kicking a 22nd-minute penalty. Wales should have scored a second try shortly afterwards when Amos breached Uruguay's defence, but it was disallowed following a forward pass by Parkes. It was poor play by Parkes, and Wales could not establish any rhythm to their game, leading by just four points entering the final 10 minutes of a forgettable first-half. Uruguay ended the first 40 minutes deep inside Wales territory, and Berchesi kicked a second penalty, making it 7-6 at the break. Wales had wasted a number of attacking opportunities, and they could have few complaints at the scoreline. Halfpenny hit the post with a long-range penalty attempt, but Wales increased their lead after 46 minutes. Sustained pressure ended with Adams claiming his fifth touchdown of the tournament, and Halfpenny's conversion opened up an eight-point lead. It was better from Wales, but they still found it difficult cracking a spirited and organised Uruguay team. Uruguay flanker Santiago Civetta was sin-binned for a technical offence 15 minutes from time, and Wales were awarded a penalty try shortly afterwards by referee Angus Gardner. Although Uruguay claimed a deserved touchdown from Kessler that Berchesi converted, Wales secured a bonus point when Williams darted over, with Halfpenny converting. And Davies administered the final blow to Uruguay when left several defenders trailing in his wake on a scorching run to the line."
